# Mass-Spectrometry-Data-Analysis-Tool

This repository contains a customTkinter-based Python tool I developed during my internship at SunLab. The tool was designed for mass spectrometry data analysis and provides functionalities such as spatial clustering, selective marker calculation, and pathway analysis.

## About the Repository

Due to the proprietary nature of the original tool, some algorithmic modules and essential functionalities have been removed to protect the original application. This repository showcases the structure of the modules I built and demonstrates the optimization techniques, such as multiprocessing, that were implemented. It also includes instruction on exporting the application as .exe file

## Features

The repository includes:
- **Module Layout**: A rough structure of the tool's modules.
- **Multiprocessing Optimization**: Demonstrates how multiprocessing was used to optimize data analysis tasks.
- **Custom Tkinter Layout**: Provides a base structure that can be used for building similar graphical applications.
- **Advanced Tkinter Functionalities**: Showcases the use of custom widgets, dynamic UI updates, and event-driven programming to handle user interactions efficiently.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Design**: Implements OOP principles for modularity and maintainability, including the use of classes for UI components, event handling, and data processing logic.

## Disclaimer

This repository does not include the full functionality of the original tool. It is intended as a reference for understanding the layout and optimization approaches used in the development process.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mass-Spectrometry-Data-Analysis-Tool.git

2. Navigate to the directory and explore the code to understand the structure and implementation.
